# Full Stack Trivia API Project
This project is a game where users can test their knowledge answering trivia questions. The task for the project was to create an API and test suite for implementing the following functionality:

Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
Delete questions.
Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
Search for questions based on a text query string.
Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
